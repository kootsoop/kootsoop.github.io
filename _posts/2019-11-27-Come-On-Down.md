# Student Engagement : Come On Down

My colleague, [David Broderick](https://djbrod.github.io/) has a Lotto Barrel that he puts numbers into. Each number is identified with one individual student in his class.  
He spins the Barrel and chooses a number, and the student has to  answer the question / complete the exercise / make a comment about the discussion point.

The aim is to engage *all* the class, not just the "squeaky wheels" who will answer every question if you let them.

Rather than buy another Lotto Barrel, and to allow this technique to be used across multiple courses in a semester, I decided to develop an app to do the same thing.
