# Student Engagement : Come On Down

My colleague, [David Broderick](https://djbrod.github.io/) has a Lotto Barrel that he puts numbers into. Each number is identified with one individual student in his class.  
He spins the Barrel and chooses a number, and the student has to  answer the question / complete the exercise / make a comment about the discussion point.

The aim is to engage *all* the class, not just the "squeaky wheels" who will answer every question if you let them.

Rather than buy another Lotto Barrel, and to allow this technique to be used across multiple courses in a semester, I decided to develop an app to do the same thing.

## An App

As well as making keeping track of multiple classes easier, an app can add other things too.  One of the things I find difficult to do is to remember all my students' names.  I generally
get there by the end of semester, but it takes a while.

The app can make use of "Directory Information" that my college has about the student. One of these pieces of information is their student ID picture.  

Below is a first rough cut of my ideas of how the app will work.
