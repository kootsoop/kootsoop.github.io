# Writing in 2021

The Twitterverse that I inhabit has various writers and related people in it.  They suggest for the improvement of your writing, actually *do* it.  So I'm going to try to spend some part of each day doing some, and this is the first attempt this year.

I write to express ideas.  I find that, having written [about something](https://kootsoop.github.io/@kootsoop-take-a-number-requirements-ooa-bb2eb6f16e3c/) or [other](https://kootsoop.github.io/@kootsoop-covid19/), I can much more easily talk about it off-the-cuff in class.  It means I've thought about the idea before. It means I have preconceived.

Just because I've thought about it before, doesn't mean I've thought about it correctly before.  When I revisit a topic, I've often had the chance to take on other information and sometimes the revisitation changes my views.  One thing I've often done when I think about specific problems or conundrums I face is to think about them deeply.  And then "background"<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> them

If I try to talk about an idea *without* having thought about it before, then my own peculiar form of "silent stutter" (block?) kicks in:  I go quiet, and words come haltingly or not at all. For me, being able to speak confidently and fluidly about a topic means I need the preparation that comes with organizing my thoughts about a topic.
