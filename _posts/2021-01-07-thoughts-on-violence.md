# Thoughts on Political Violence

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution reads in full:

 > *A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, 
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*

The [violent protests overnight](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/capitol-breach-trump-protests.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) at the US Capitol building that tried
to subvert the results of the November 3<sup>rd</sup> election did not involve **Arms**, at least generally on the side of the protesters.  One protester was shot and killed by the Capitol Police. That got me thinking: what does the term **free State** mean in the wording above?

[Volokh's article](https://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/freestate.pdf) *NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY OF A FREE STATE* gives a definition:

> *In eighteenth-century political discourse, “free state” was a commonly used political term of art, meaning “free country,” which is to say the opposite of a despotism.*

So, were the protesters acting against an act of:

 > [*the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way*](https://www.google.com/search?q=despotism&oq=Despotism&aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433i457j0i131i433l2j0j0i395l4.2391j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

?

For me, the protesters were the despots. 

*Despots* try to override the will of the people.

*Despots* chase our democratically elected representatives from the House and Senate.

*Despots* damage the people's property and parade it around, [glorifying Auschwitz.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErH9mBJXAAUYq8K?format=jpg&name=large)

Thankfully, the House and Senate reconvened and Mike Pence did his duty to the Constitution and confirmed, yet again, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take office on January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021.

But the despots are still there, and more work is needed to defuse them.
