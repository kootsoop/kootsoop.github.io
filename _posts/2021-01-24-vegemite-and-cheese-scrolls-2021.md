## Ingredients

 * 2 1/2 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surfaces.
 * 1 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder
 * 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
 * 1/2 teaspoon of salt
 * 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper
 * 1 1/4 cups of milk
 * 1 tablespoon of lemon or lime juice
 * 5 tablespoons (1/4 stick) of melted butter (2 for dough, 2 to top, 1 for pan)
 * 2 tablespoons of Vegemite (well, to taste really!)
 * 1 cup grated cheese

## Method

### Preparation
1. Adjust oven rack to middle-upper position and heat the oven to 425F (220C).
2. Pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter into a 9-inch (23cm) nonstick cake pan and coat the bottom and sides with a pastry brush (or greaseproof paper).

### The scrolls

1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper into a large bowl.
2. Whisk the milk, juice, and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter in a measuring cup. If necessary, heat in microwave to keep butter melted.
3. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients until it's even.
4. The dough will look very shaggy and be sticky.
5. Use your hands to knead the dough until it's *just* smooth and no longer shaggy. Do not over-knead.
6. Pat the dough with your hands into a 12 inch (30cm) by 9 inch (23cm) rectangle. Make sure the thickness is reasonably even.
7. Cover the dough with Vegemite.
8. Sprinkle the cheese over the Vegemite.
9. Starting with the long side, roll the dough into a log.
10. Press the end side into the rest of the log to seal.
11. Cut the log into 12 to 16 equal-sized scrolls.
12. Place the scrolls into the prepared 9 inch (23cm) pan. They should fill the pan, but not be too tightly packed as they'll rise a bit when baked.
13. Sprinkle extra cheese across the top if desired (I didn't do this in the picture above).
14. Bake until the tops of the scrolls are golden brown, about 25 minutes (I tend to check after 20 minutes, if I don't know the oven well).
