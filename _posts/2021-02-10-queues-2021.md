During my *Data Structures* class we are soon to look at [the FIFO: a queue.](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/queue-implementation-details/#queue-implementation-details)  So I thought it might be fun to look at some queuing theory, not the data structures but how queues are modeled.

The sorts of parameters we need to set up a queue are:

 * How quickly do customers arrive?
 * How quickly do customers get served?
 * How many servers are there?
 * How many customers can the queue hold?
 * How does the queue operate?

Here, "customer" could also be a "job" or a "process" and "served could mean "start" (a job) or "execute" (a process).

## a/b/c/d/e queues

These parameters are usually captured as five numbers or letters.

The standard queue is usually denoted 

	M/M/1  

where the two `M`s represent that the distribution of the arrival and service rates is Markovian, and there is only a single server.  The `d` part (capacity) is assumed infinite, and the `e` part is first-in, first-out (FIFO).

For simplicity, I'm going to assume that the queue operates as I said above: FIFO. Another option is last in first out (LIFO). 
## The details 

The labels that are often given for each of these parameters are:

* $\lambda$ - the average number of arrivals per unit time.
* $\mu$ - the average number served per unit time.
* $c$ - the number of servers able to work in parallel.
* $K$ - the capacity of the queue (how many customers can the queue hold)

In addition to the averages $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we also need to know the distributions of the arrivals and services.

These are often chosen to be a Poisson process (Markovian), so the distribution is an exponential distribution. 

[The probability of having $n$ arrivals in a time interval $t$ is given by](https://virtuaq.com/blog/2017-11-23-basics-of-queuing-theory)

$$P_n(t) = \lambda t \exp(-\lambda t) / n!$$

and the time between arrivals is then

$$f(t) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda t), \ \ \ t \ge 0 $$

Similarly, the service times follow similar Poisson distributions when the Markovian option is taken.

## Upshot

One quick metric we can look at on how well an `M/M/1` queue performs is the average number of customers in the system, $L$.

$$L = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c \mu}$.
