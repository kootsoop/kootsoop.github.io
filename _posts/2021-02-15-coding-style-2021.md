 I've been requesting that the data structures students indent their code, and that's it.  It still doesn't help sometimes.

Coding style is a matter of taste.

The trouble is, different people on a software team have different tastes.

## Forcing a style

When I first taught a coding course, I decided that students needed to adhere to a style guide that I set.  I discussed it with the students, and there was contention even from the start: some preferred 2-space tab stops while others preferred 4-space tab stops.

So the style I forced on them used 3-space tab stops, a healthy compromise.

Or so I thought.

The students *hated* it, and hated me because of it.

Lesson learnt.

## Forcing agreement on a style

The next time I taught the same course, I set a meta-style: the teams of students had to agree amongst themselves on a coding style, and the style had to include:

 * Number of spaces to use in tab stops.
 * The way variables, classes, constants, and methods would be named.
 * The structure of the program they'd use.

This approach was much more successful. Instead of hating *me*, they hated **their teammates.**

## Other coding styles

There are lots of coding styles around and they vary by platform, project, and language.

* [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
* [Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Style Guide](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style)
* [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)
* [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)

The Linux kernel coding style is interesting: it says that the indentation tab stops should be 8 spaces!

## Curly brace alignment

Apart from consistent indentation of code, the most important for me is where the curly braces that indicate code blocks line up.

One approach is:

    public static main(String[] arguments) {

	}

which is the [Java style.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.7-grouping-parentheses)

Another is

    public static main(String[] arguments) 
	{

	}

which is my preferred style... except that some languages ([JavaScript and Go](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2013/04/where-do-curly-braces-belong.html)) are either problematic (JavaScript will auto-insert a semi-colon if it thinks you've forgotten it) or forced (Go forces opening brace on the same line).


Why do I prefer this second approach?  Primarily it's because I find it easier to see matching braces. Provided the code is otherwise indented properly, I can just scan up and down to find the match.  Otherwise I have to scan up and to the right... by some unknown amount.

It's a minor, minor point, but that's my preference.

[This post on the Software Engineering StackExchange site gives some more detailed commentary on it.](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/2786/2722)

Whichever style you use, **be consistent.**
