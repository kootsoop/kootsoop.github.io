I started with [this recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/really-good-vegetarian-meatloaf-really-33921), but wanted to use fresh green leafy vegetables instead of the dried ones. I also wanted to give it a bit more bite, so I added some fresh green chiles.

## Ingredients

 * 2 cups water
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 1 cup green lentils
 * 1 small onion, diced
 * 1 cup quick-cooking oats
 * 3/4 cup sharp cheese
 * 1 egg, beaten
 * 4 1/2 ounces pizza tomato sauce (I had this left over, but a similar amount of reduced tinned tomatoes works)
 * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
 * 1/2 cup frozen fresh basil
 * 1/2 cup frozen fresh parsley
 * 1/2 cup fresh chopped chiles
 * 1/4 teaspoon seasoning salt
 * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Method

 * Bring salt and water to boil in a saucepan.
 * Add lentils and simmer covered 25-30 minutes. Lentils are cooked once all water has been absorbed and the lentils have started to split and are soft.
 * Remove from heat.
 * In a bowl partially mash lentils and allow them to cool.
 * Once lentils have cooled, mix in chopped onion, oats, egg, tomato sauce, garlic, basil, parsley, chiles, seasoning salt and pepper.
 * Line a loaf tin with parchment paper.
 * Spoon into the lined loaf tin, ensuring that the top is smoothed flat.
 * Bake at 175C (350F) for 40 minutes or until top of loaf is dry, firm and golden brown.
 * Cool for 10 minutes, and then turn load out onto a serving platter.
