A friend is going vegan for health reasons, and I wanted to bring some baked goods to their place, so thought I'd try this out.

Most commercial peanut butter chips use milk products, so I decided to make my own too.

I started with [this recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/double-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/), and then modified it a bit.

These turned out more like a museli bar or granola bar than what I think of as "biscuits" (Australian version). I want to revisit this recipe and try to get more "snap" into them.  The peanut butter bits are yummy. 

## Ingredients

### Vegan Peanut Butter Bits

 * 4 tablespoons coconut oil
 * 1/2 cup of peanut butter (smooth probably best here)
 * 1 tablespoon of golden syrup
 
### Vegan Cookies

 * 1 cup of peanuts
 * 1 cup cut up dates 
 * 1/2 cup mashed banana
 * 2 tablespoons peanut butter
 * 1 cup almond flour
 * 1 cup rolled oats
 * 1/4 cup peanut butter chips (see recipe)
 * 1/4 cup dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips

## Method

### Vegan Peanut Butter Bits

1. Prepare a sheet of parchment / waxed paper on a board with shallow sides.
1. Melt the coconut butter in the microwave until runny.
1. Mix in peanut butter and golden syrup until smooth.
1. Smooth the mixture over the parchment until it is even.
1. Freeze the sheet until it is solid.
1. Score and cut into good-sized pieces.
1. Store in freezer, if not used immediately.

### Vegan Cookies

1. Place peanuts in food processor and process until sandy / very small pieces.
1. Place dates into a food processor and process until it's in small pieces.
1. Add mashed banana and peanut butter. Blend again.
1. Add almond flour and rolled oats and process until a dough forms.
1. If dough is still wet, add a bit more almond flour and/or rolled oats.
1. Move dough to a mixing bowl and add peanut butter chips and chocolate chips.
1. Preheat oven for 10 minutes or to to 175 C. 
1. While oven is heating, put the dough in the refrigerator and prepare parchment paper on baking trays for cookies.
1. Once oven is at temperature, scoop out 1 tablespoon sized blobs of dough onto parchment paper. This made about 30 cookies for me. [YMMV](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ymmv)
1. Bake cookies for about 18 minutes.  I needed two trays for the cookies, so I swapped the shelves the trays were on in the oven at 9 minutes.
1. Transfer to cooling rack and let cool for a bit.
